[Can AI really code? Study maps the roadblocks to autonomous software engineering](https://news.mit.edu/2025/can-ai-really-code-study-maps-roadblocks-to-autonomous-software-engineering-0716)  

## Why I Find It Interesting
This article digs into what it will actually take for software engineering to move from AI‐assisted to more autonomous workflows. It doesn’t just celebrate the potential of AI, it maps the “roadblocks”, things like understanding context, ensuring reliability, maintaining code quality, debugging across modules, handling unexpected inputs, etc. I like this one because it shows a balanced perspective: there’s both a lot of excitement and real challenges ahead. It also suggests research directions rather than just hype, which is important for long-term progress.
